        <div class="limitations-intro">
            <p>While this experiment successfully demonstrated the effect of skin contact on metal-acid reactions, several significant limitations should be acknowledged. These constraints may have influenced the precision and generalizability of our findings. Below, we provide a critical analysis of these limitations.</p>

                <h3>Surface Area Inconsistency (Steel Wool)</h3>
                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> While zinc and magnesium samples could be measured precisely at 0.3g, steel wool presented a unique challenge. The fibrous nature of steel wool makes it difficult to ensure consistent surface area across samples. Two 0.3g portions of steel wool may have very different exposed surface areas depending on how tightly they are packed.</p>
                <p><strong>Impact:</strong> This inconsistency could have caused significant variation in steel wool reaction times, independent of the surface contamination effect we were testing. Our results for steel may be less reliable than those for solid metals.</p>
                <p><strong>How it affected results:</strong> Steel wool showed the most dramatic difference between cleaned and contaminated conditions (65s vs 160s). However, some of this variation might be due to surface area differences rather than purely the skin oil effect.</p>
            </div>

                <h3>Manual Reaction Timing</h3>
                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Reaction times were recorded manually by stopping a digital stopwatch when the reaction appeared to "significantly slow." This endpoint is subjective and varies based on observer perception.</p>
                <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Each trial could have ±2-3 second variation due to human judgment alone. What one person considers "significantly slowed" another might interpret differently. This introduces systematic and random error into all measurements.</p>
                <p><strong>How it affected results:</strong> Some of the variation between trials might reflect observer inconsistency rather than true experimental differences.</p>

                <h3>Incomplete Removal of Skin Oils During Cleaning</h3>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> In this study, metal samples were thoroughly cleaned with sandpaper and rinsed with deionized water. However, at the microscopic level, oils are notoriously difficult to remove completely from any surface. Theoretical residues at the nanometer scale may still exist despite thorough cleaning protocols.</p>
                <p><strong>Impact:</strong> While we believe we achieved a sufficiently "clean" state for comparison, the "cleaned" condition may not be absolutely pristine at the molecular level. This could mean our observed slowdown factor represents a lower bound rather than the maximum possible effect.</p>
                <p><strong>How it affected results:</strong> Our observed slowdown factor of ~2.4× might actually be conservative - theoretically cleaned metals might show even greater reactivity if oils could be removed at the molecular level.</p>

                <h3>Room Temperature - Controlled Condition</h3>
                <p><strong>Status:</strong> All experiments were conducted at room temperature (constant throughout the study day). This was a strength of the experimental design, not a limitation.</p>
                <p><strong>Control Applied:</strong> By keeping temperature constant, we eliminated temperature as a variable, allowing us to isolate the effect of skin contact on reaction rates.</p>
                <p><strong>How it affected results:</strong> This consistent temperature provides confidence that observed differences in reaction times are due to surface conditions, not thermal effects.</p>

                <h3>Single Individual for Skin Contact</h3>
                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> All skin contact tests were performed by the same person. Skin composition, oil production, and skin pH vary significantly between individuals and even throughout the day for the same person.</p>
                <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Results may not generalize to other individuals with different skin types (oily, dry, sensitive) or different environmental conditions. The findings represent one specific case rather than a universal principle.</p>
                <p><strong>How it affected results:</strong> Results are specific to this individual's skin chemistry and cannot be claimed to be universal without testing with multiple people.</p>

The effect is clear, reproducible, and significant. However, the exact magnitude of the effect and its universality across different conditions remain somewhat uncertain.</p>
                <p><strong>Validity:</strong> The experiment is valid as a demonstration that surface contamination matters in chemistry. However, it should be viewed as a preliminary investigation rather than a definitive study. The limitations described above suggest the findings would benefit from replication with more rigorous controls.</p>
                <p><strong>Contribution:</strong> Despite limitations, this work provides evidence for an interesting phenomenon and raises important questions about laboratory procedures, sample preparation, and the role of human factors in chemical experiments.</p>
